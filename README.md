## FYI

Just a screenshot of me last night realizing at 8pm that I was doing completely the wrong homework.



Just FYI, I started this homework last night at 8:30pm. I think it turn out decent, but I would 
love to hear your honest feedback. Not pictured: me sitting is disbelief for two minutes after reading this
message.
